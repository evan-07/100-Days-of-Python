## The deck is unlimited in size. 
## There are no jokers. 
## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
## Use the following list as the deck of cards:
## cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
## The computer is the dealer.

##################### Hints #####################

#Hint 1: Go to this website and try out the Blackjack game: 
#   https://games.washingtonpost.com/games/blackjack/
#Then try out the completed Blackjack project here: 
#   http://blackjack-final.appbrewery.repl.run

#Hint 2: Read this breakdown of program requirements: 
#   http://listmoz.com/view/6h34DJpvJBFVRlZfJvxF
#Then try to create your own flowchart for the program.

#Hint 3: Download and read this flow chart I've created: 
#   https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1rDkiHCrhaf9eX7u7yjM1qwSuyEk-rPnt

#Hint 4: Create a deal_card() function that uses the List below to *return* a random card.
#11 is the Ace.
import random

cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]

card = 0
def deal_card():
  card = random.choice(cards)
  return card

#Hint 5: Deal the user and computer 2 cards each using deal_card() and append().
user_cards = []
user_cards.append(deal_card()) # draw the first user card
user_cards.append(deal_card()) # draw the second user card
print(f"User cards: {user_cards}")

computer_cards = []
computer_cards.append(deal_card()) # draw the first user card
computer_cards.append(deal_card()) # draw the second user card
print(f"Computer card: {computer_cards[0]} , ?")

#Hint 6: Create a function called calculate_score() that takes a List of cards as input 
#and returns the score. 
#Look up the sum() function to help you do this.

def calculate_score(cards):
  if len(cards) == 2 and sum(cards) == 21:
    return 0 # blackjack
  elif 11 in cards and sum(cards) > 21:
    cards.remove(11)
    cards.append(1)
    return sum(cards)
  else:
    return sum(cards) # get the sum of card list

user_cards_sum = calculate_score(user_cards)
computer_cards_sum = calculate_score(computer_cards)
#print(user_cards_sum)
#print(computer_cards_sum)

def check_sum():
  if user_cards_sum == 0:
    print("game ends, winner is user")
    print(f"User cards: {user_cards}")
    print(f"User score: {user_cards_sum}")
    print(f"Computer cards: {computer_cards}")
    print(f"Computer score: {computer_cards_sum}")  
    exit()

#Hint 7: Inside calculate_score() check for a blackjack (a hand with only 2 cards: ace + 10) and return 0 instead of the actual score. 0 will represent a blackjack in our game.
#Hint 8: Inside calculate_score() check for an 11 (ace). If the score is already over 21, remove the 11 and replace it with a 1. You might need to look up append() and remove().
#Hint 9: Call calculate_score(). If the computer or the user has a blackjack (0) or if the user's score is over 21, then the game ends.

#Hint 10: If the game has not ended, ask the user if they want to draw another card. If yes, then use the deal_card() function to add another card to the user_cards List. If no, then the game has ended.

#Hint 11: The score will need to be rechecked with every new card drawn and the checks in Hint 9 need to be repeated until the game ends.

#Hint 12: Once the user is done, it's time to let the computer play. The computer should keep drawing cards as long as it has a score less than 17.

#Hint 13: Create a function called compare() and pass in the user_score and computer_score. If the computer and user both have the same score, then it's a draw. If the computer has a blackjack (0), then the user loses. If the user has a blackjack (0), then the user wins. If the user_score is over 21, then the user loses. If the computer_score is over 21, then the computer loses. If none of the above, then the player with the highest score wins.

#Hint 14: Ask the user if they want to restart the game. If they answer yes, clear the console and start a new game of blackjack and show the logo from art.py.
